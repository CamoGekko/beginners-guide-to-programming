  <p>
    An important part of cybersec is passwords and how secure your passwords are, if you have insecure passwords then you will get hacked faster, single word passwords get hacked extremely easily. So your passwords
    should be a non-real word like "polly" or "liken", but those will still get hacked pretty easily so make them longer like, "twocando", this is a relatively secure password but to make it even more secure you
    can add numbers symbols and capitals. A password with those would look like "23#tWocandO^". Please also note that the format [capital letter][lowercase letters][numbers][symbol] (like "Love2018!") is 
    vulnerable to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enumeration">enumeration</a>(trying every combination) more so than other formats like the one i gaave to you above
