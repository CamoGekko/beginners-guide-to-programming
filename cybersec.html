  <h2 class="center">Passwords</h2>
  <p>
    An important part of cybersec is passwords and how secure your passwords are, if you have insecure passwords then you will get hacked faster, single word passwords get hacked extremely easily. So your passwords
    should be a non-real word like "polly" or "liken", but those will still get hacked pretty easily so make them longer like, "twocando", this is a relatively secure password but to make it even more secure you
    can add numbers symbols and capitals. A password with those would look like "23#tWocandO^". Please also note that the format [capital letter][lowercase letters][numbers][symbol] (like "Love2018!") is 
    vulnerable to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enumeration">enumeration</a>(trying every combination) more so than other formats like the one i gaave to you above

      <h2>Recognize Phishing Attempts</h2>
      <p>Phishing is a common method used by cybercriminals to trick you into revealing personal information. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages that ask for sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Look for signs like spelling mistakes, generic greetings, and mismatched URLs. If you're unsure about a message, it's best to verify its authenticity through a separate communication channel.</p>
