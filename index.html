  <h1>The Beginners Guide to Programming</h1>
  <h2>Logical Thinking</h2>
  <p>
    A key component of programming is the logical thinking behind actually creating this code. 
    Programming is just a bunch of logic gates with commands in the middle. 
    Being able to think like this is extremely important if you want to code. 
    A large part of logical thinking is understanding algorithms. 
    Here is a document that explains a lot of what you need to know about algorithms 
    <a href="camogekko.github.io/beginners-guide-to-programming/algorithms.html"> (doc)</a> 
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding how a Computer works</h2>
  <p>Programming is much easier when you know what you’re using to program. 
    Some things are possible only on one device and something else only on a different one. 
    For the most part, hardware is a general topic that doesnt change much across the board. 
    However when you get to software it gets interesting. 
    Some programs only run on windows and some only run on linux and/or mac, as shown 
    <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/differences-between-windows-macos-and-linux-operating-systems#:~:text=Security%20and%20stability&text=Linux%3A%20Linux%20is%20often%20considered,the%20hardware%20and%20software%20ecosystem.">here</a>
    there is many differences between these OS’ (operating systems) and they each have their own use case. 
    For programming Linux is often a first choice although Windows is used 
    in situations like developing a windows application.

    <h2>Miscellaneous Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
    <p>It is very important to know how data works and how to manipulate it, if you have time
      I recommend the video but the two sites is fine if you dont want to spend 5 hours 
      watching a video

  <h3>Version Control</h3>
  <p>
    Systems like Git offer a plethora of features to manage your code quickly and easily and is the standard management system for many corporations
    This will be taught here but if you also want to read about it on your own then <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/git/">here is a source</a>
