        <h2 class="center">Understanding Blockchain Technology and Its Potential Uses</h2>
        <p>Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about data and transactions. At its core, blockchain is a type of digital ledger that records information in a secure and decentralized manner. Here’s a simple breakdown of what blockchain is and how it can be used.</p>

        <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
        <p>A blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together in a specific order, creating a continuous chain. Each block is secured and verified by a network of computers (called nodes), making the system decentralized and extremely difficult to tamper with.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Unlike traditional databases controlled by a single entity, blockchain is maintained by a network of computers, making it more secure and transparent.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one, ensuring that data cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are recorded on a public ledger that anyone can view, promoting transparency and trust.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Uses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Blockchain is best known for being the technology behind <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies, allowing for secure and transparent financial transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Companies can use blockchain to track the journey of goods from origin to destination, ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> These are self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code, automating and securing agreements without the need for intermediaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Blockchain can ensure transparent and tamper-proof voting processes, enhancing trust in electoral systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Patient records can be securely stored and shared on a blockchain, improving privacy and coordination between medical providers.</li>
        </ul>
